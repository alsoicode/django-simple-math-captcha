django-simple-math-captcha
==========================

What is it?
===========
A multi-value-field that presents a human answerable question,
with no settings.py configuration necessary, but instead can be
configured with arguments to the field constructor.

Installation
============
You can do any of the following to install ``django-simple-math-captcha``

- Run ``pip install django-simple-math-captcha``.
- Download or "git clone" the package and run ``setup.py``.
- Download or "git clone" the package and put the ``simplemathcaptcha``
  directory on your ``PYTHONPATH``.

Usage
=====

Forms
-----
To add the captcha field to your form::

    from django import forms
    from simplemathcaptcha.fields import MathCaptchaField
    
    class MyForm(forms.Form):
        some_text_field = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        captcha = MathCaptchaField()

Optionally, you can pass in the following arguments to the field to configure it.

start_int
    The number at which the field should begin its range of random numbers.
    This value will be used passed into the creation of a
    ``simplemathcaptcha.widgets.MathCaptchaWidget`` for this field.

    Default value: ``1``

end_int
    The number at which the field should end its range of random numbers.
    This value will be used passed into the creation of an
    ``simplemathcaptcha.widgets.MathCaptchaWidget`` for this field.

    Default value: ``10``

error_messages
    A dictionary of error messages.  The keys you can use are ``invalid``
    and ``invalid_number``.

    invalid
        is the message to display when the provided answer is incorrect

        Default value: ``"Check your math and try again."``

    invalid_number
        is the message to display when the entry is not a whole
        number

        Default value: ``"Enter a whole number."``

question_tmpl
    A string with format placeholders to use for the displayed question.

    Default value: ``"What is %(num1)i %(operator)s %(num2)i?"``

question_class
    A css class to use for the span containing the displayed question.

    Default value: ``"captcha-question"``

widget
    The widget instance to use, instead of the field creating an instance
    of ``simplemathcaptcha.widgets.MathCaptchaWidget``.  When provided,
    it must be an instatiated widget, not a widget class.

    Additionally, when specifying ``widget``, you must not specify
    ``start_int`` or ``end_int``.

    Default value: ``None``


Rationale
=========
Other math captcha fields can present questions that require decimal answers,
answers that could be negative values and that require settings.py configuration.
This project aims to provide a single field with minimal or no configuration
necessary and reduce or prevent spam form submissions.

Status
======
django-simple-math-captcha is currently used in production.

Feautures
=========
- Simple addition, subtraction or multiplication question for captcha
- No configuration necessary
- Question asked changes with every render
- Uses SHA1 hashing of answer with your SECRET_KEY
- Unit tests are provided in the source

Requirements
============
- Python 2.6+
- Django 1.4+
